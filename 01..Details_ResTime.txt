Instructions to obtain ResTime heat maps: See folder "01.ResTime"

1. Start with ascii files containing X and Y coordinate in a time stamped order. The information is stored without headers and using tab delimited format.

2. Each ascii file corresponds to a single animal's performance.

3. Use the following GUI to convert ascii to residence time heat maps.

4. Enter video frame xy dimensions.

5. Click "File > Generate HM from XYData ASII"

6. The heat maps appear as output in the same folder as the input ascii files (e.g., Map_of_I-1 and so on)
