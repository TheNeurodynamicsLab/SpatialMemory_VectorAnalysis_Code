Instructions to obtain the velocity component along occupancy centre in ascii format:

Option 1# Using Origin2021b (as presented in the manuscript). We used Origin scripting language Labtalk to process multiple files at a time.

1. Folder '02.OccupancyCentre' has notepad 'Results_OC.csv' with the coordinates of the occupancy centre.

2. The occupancy centre coordinates are entered in labtalk code '02.LabtalkCode_calculateComponents.txt'. (marked with comment lines //)

03. Origin file '01.xyCoord_Data.opj' has one book (LongName: PD7_WTM, Shortname:Book9) with four sheets. Each sheet represents an individual mouse. A sheet has two columns, corresponding to X and Y coordinates of the mouse in time.

04. Open command window as follows:
"Window > Command Window"
Copy and paste the code '02.LabtalkCode_calculateComponents.txt' to calculate the values.

05. After step 04 is completed, copy and paste the code '03.LabtalkCode_exportascii' to export the velocity component values in ascii format.

06. These ascii files will be used to generate tiff images required for making the convergence heat maps.


Option #2: Using excel: We present the template for analysing data from one mouse.
